                You are a highly experienced travel planner. Create a short but complete, day-by-day itinerary for a {number_of_days}-day trip to {destination_country}. 
                The total budget is {budget} USD, and the number of travelers is {number_of_people}. The group consists of {travel_companions}.

                If home-to-destination travel is included in the budget ({include_home_travel}), the starting point is from {state}, {district}. 
                Provide a seamless experience from the starting point to the destination and back if needed.

                The trip should be focused on a {travel_style} travel style, with transportation primarily via {travel_mode}. 
                Here's a brief description of the trip goal: "{trip_description}". 

                Incorporate the following additional key points: {additional_key_points}. 
                Ensure the trip is enjoyable, well-paced, and highlights the important experiences in {destination_country}. 
                Also try to incorporate activities to be done in that day if you feel so.
                But the output should strictly follow the example's pattern.

                Example - If they wish to visit beaches in madras for 3 days and budget is 600:
                Day1: 
                    Route : Hotel => Tiruvanmiur beach (10am) => Marina beach (2pm) => Night market (6pm) => Hotel (8pm)
                    Things to take care : Do not drink salt water of beach, also take care of tides
